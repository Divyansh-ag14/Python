A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running.

* It can be pre-empted (interrupted)
* It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.
